# SHELF - A NOTE TAKING APP TO BE RUN ON THE COMMAND LINE OR TERMINAL WINDOW

# I started this project to test my proficiency in using python modules, dealing with conditionals and loops, recursions and modularising code. This is a far cry from what i had in mind when i started but I'd say I'm not that disapponted and i have learned alot so far.

# PLEASE PERADVENTURE YOU NOTICE ANY CRASH OR BUGS WHILE TESTING PLS SCREENSHOT THE ERROR REPORT ON THE TERMINAL AND SEND TO MY EMAIL(tholuwarlarshe2003@gmail.com).

# TO START, CD into the project directory and RUN - 'python main.py' on your CMD or Terminal

# Changelogs:

1. I created the user creation and validation functions.
2. Moved all validation related functions to Validations.py module.
3. Initiated the notes.py module.
4. Added the functions to create, update, search and delete notes.
5. Added 'section' functionality - a section is a folder inside a users main shelf(directory). its aim was to enable users group notes in various categories they create.
# I also broke the search functionality during this stage(i hope to fix it in future buids)
6. Added functionality to move notes from the main shelf(directory) to a section.
7. Added functionality to open and delete notes in sections and some other minor improvements and bug fixes.
8. Added functionality to remove notes from a section and place it back in the main shelf and some minor fixes. 
# i still haven't fixed the search functionality yet
